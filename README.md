# SumItUp
The player's objective is to choose a target number and then create a grid of other numbers in such a way that the sum of the columns and rows equals the chosen target number. The goal is to maximize the number of columns and rows that meet this criterion.

## MVP Plan

1. **Game Board:**
   - The main game board should display the grid of numbers.
   - Each cell in the grid will contain a number.
   - The grid should be visually organized with rows and columns.

2. **Target Number Input:**
   - Provide an input field or a dropdown menu where the player can choose the target number.
   - Include a button to confirm the target number selection.

3. **Scoring and Feedback:**
   - Display the player's score prominently on the interface.
   - Give feedback when the player successfully forms rows or columns that meet the target number requirement.

4. **Timer or Move Counter (Optional):**
   - Depending on the game's design, you can include a timer or a move counter to add a time or move-based challenge.

5. **Controls:**
   - Implement intuitive controls for rearranging numbers in the grid. For example, players should be able to click and drag numbers to swap them.

6. **Reset and Undo:**
   - Include buttons to reset the game board or undo moves if the player wishes to start over or correct a mistake.

7. **Difficulty Levels (Optional):**
   - If you plan to have multiple difficulty levels, provide an option for players to choose their preferred level.

8. **Visual Design:**
   - Pay attention to the overall visual design, including the colors, fonts, and layout, to make the game appealing and user-friendly.

9. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure that the interface is responsive, so it can adapt to different screen sizes and orientations for a seamless experience on various devices.

10. **Instructions and Rules:**
    - Include a section where players can access game instructions and rules. This can be a popup or a separate page.

11. **Leaderboard (Optional):**
    - Consider adding a leaderboard to encourage competition among players.

12. **Sound Effects and Music (Optional):**
    - If desired, you can include sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming experience.
